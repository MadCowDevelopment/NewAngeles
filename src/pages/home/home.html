  <h2>Solitaire Rules for New Angeles by JK777</h2>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>New Angeles is beset by a covert group bent on ensuring the Federalists take over. The player must take control of a
      group of Corporations that need to work together to stop the group and maintain control of New Angeles
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Unless stated otherwise follow the rules that came with the game; these are referred to as the “normal rules”. Set out
      below are the changes to those rules that must be followed in this solo variant.
    </li>
    <li>The player is required to play three corporations. These corporations are separate entities and the player is not allowed
      to trade cards or capital between the three corporations except where allowed by a specific Action or Asset card.
    </li>
    <li>Player, in these rules, refers to the person playing the solo variant. Corporation is used where player would generally
      be used in the normal rules. Substitute the word Corporation for the word player in the normal rules as appropriate.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose three corporations and follow the set up rules as set out in the normal game, except for the following two changes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Return the Rival cards to the box and do not perform step 10 of the set up. Rival cards are not used in the solo variant.
        </li>
        <li>Instead of drawing two investment cards per player, just draw two investment cards. Keep 1 and return the other to
          the top of the Investment Deck.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Standard Round</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Follow the steps in a Standard round per the normal rules: Refresh, Resolve Deal, End of Turn, Production Phase and Event
      Phase.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps of a Deal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Asset:</strong> Draw the rightmost Asset card and place it in the revealed Asset box.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Main Offer:</strong> The Active Corporation proposes a Main Offer
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Counter-offer:</strong> The player rolls d100 and refers to the Counter-offer table. This details the number
      of Action cards that must be played to win the current deal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Support:</strong> In clockwise order, the player can play cards for the other two Corporations in support of
      the Main Offer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resolution:</strong> If the Main Offer has at least the number of Action cards detailed on the Counter-offer
      table then the Active Corporation claims the revealed Asset card.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the Main Offer has fewer than the number of Action cards detailed on the Counter-offer then discard the Asset card and
      resolve the Effect shown on the Counter-offer table.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Demand Round</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Score Investment:</strong> Resolve the Investment card. The player chooses which Corporation gains the capital.
      Any capital earned cannot be split between two or more corporations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pay Demand &amp; Reveal Demand:</strong> Remain unchanged from the normal rules.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose Investment:</strong> The player draws two investment cards and keeps one.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Winning &amp; Losing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The player loses if threat reaches 25 or if the player fails to score 25 capital (see below).
    </li>
    <li>
      The player’s score at the end of the game is the <strong>lowest capital</strong> (score) of the three corporations.
    </li>
    <li>
      To increase the difficulty reduce the starting the capital of the three corporations. For example instead of 10, 11 and 12
      try 7, 8 and 9.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Asset Cards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Unless stated below the text and effect of Asset cards remains unchanged.
    </li>
    <li>
      The text on certain asset cards needs to be amended in the solo rules.
    </li>
    <li>
      Coach Walden: When the Corporation to your right wins a deal, gain 1 capital
    </li>
    <li>
      Saul Eustecio: When the Main Offer fails you may exhaust this card....

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
